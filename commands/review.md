Review ADVPL/TLPP code for best practices, performance, security, and modernization opportunities.

## Usage

```bash
/advpl-specialist:review <target> [--focus category]
```

## Focus Categories

| Focus | Description |
|-------|------------|
| `boas-praticas` | Best practices: variables, locks, error handling, naming |
| `performance` | Performance: queries, loops, indexing |
| `seguranca` | Security: SQL injection, input validation, credentials |
| `modernizacao` | Modernization: ADVPL→TLPP, legacy patterns |
| `all` | All categories (default) |

## Process

1. **Parse arguments** - Identify target file(s) and optional `--focus` category
2. **Load review reference** - Read `skills/advpl-code-review/reference.md` and read relevant rules files
3. **Delegate to code-reviewer agent** - Pass targets and focus to the code-reviewer agent for systematic analysis
4. **Present findings** - Structured report grouped by severity with actionable fix suggestions

## Examples

```bash
# Review a single source file (all categories)
/advpl-specialist:review src/FATA001.prw

# Review an entire directory focusing on performance
/advpl-specialist:review src/ --focus performance

# Review REST endpoints for security issues
/advpl-specialist:review src/REST/*.tlpp --focus seguranca

# Review current directory for modernization opportunities
/advpl-specialist:review . --focus modernizacao

# Review specific files for best practices
/advpl-specialist:review src/MATA010.prw --focus boas-praticas
```

## Output

- Findings grouped by file and severity (CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO)
- Each finding includes: rule ID, file:line reference, current code, suggested fix, and explanation
- Summary table with counts per category and severity
- Actionable recommendations prioritized by impact
